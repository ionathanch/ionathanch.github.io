While travelling I got sushi from a shop in the airport.
It was okay. The ingredients list, though, was curiously long,
and while waiting for boarding I had time to inspect it.
Here's a photo of the original label with the ingredients.

If you read it carefully you'll find that there's two (!) levels
of nesting in this list, which makes it a little hard to parse.
Here it is again, now as a properly-formatted nested list.

It's a very long list.
It's a little surprising how many of these things have sugar in
themâ€”why does the rice have sugar?
What I'm most interested in, though, is *what* some of these things are
and *why* they're in there.

## Sugars and Sugar Alcohols

(trehalose, sorbitol)

## Acids

(citric, malic, ascetic, ascorbic)
