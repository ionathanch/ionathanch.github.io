Known as RIGHT ANGLE WITH DOWARDS ZIGZAG ARROW,
angle with down zig-zag arrow,
`\rangledownzigzagarrow`,
and `&angzarr;`,
no one knows what ⍼ is meant to represent or where it originated from.
[Section 22.7 Technical Symbols](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch22.pdf#G12269)
from the Unicode Standard on the
[Miscellaneous Technical](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf) block
doesn't say anything about it.

The original proposal that included this character is
[Proposal for Encoding Additional Mathematical Symbols in the BMP (N2191)](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n2191.pdf)
from 14 March 2000, with origins from the
[STIX project](https://www.ams.org/STIX/).
That project page links to a number of relevant files dating all the way back to 1997,
and most importantly to the very first collation of
[character tables](https://www.ams.org/STIX/bnbranges.html) by Barbara Beeton
last updated on 24 June 1997.
Here we find that, in table [&ac-&cirmid](http://www.ams.org/STIX/bnbtable09a.html)
under codes with TR 9573 names, an entry for the character.

> **AFII** | **ISO TR9573 entity** | **ISO TR9573 description**
  D97C | &amp;angzarr; | angle with down zig-zag arrow

(This table is later merged into a [larger table](http://www.ams.org/STIX/table09.html).)
A [table from 18 July 1997](https://www.ams.org/STIX/bnb/9573-13.file)
clarifies that these are characters from the technical report TR 9573-13.
A later [table from 7 Feburary 1998](http://www.ams.org/STIX/stixfullr/stixfull-12.html)
with accompanying glyphs confirms that this is indeed the character we're looking for.

> **Unicode** | **Glyph** | **SGML** | **Name** | **Description**
  E248 | <img id="angzarr" src="https://www.ams.org/STIX/glyphs/E2/UE248.gif"/> | angzarr | ISOAMSA | angle with down zig-zag arrow

The Unicode code point E248 is, of course, not its current actual code point.
That one is located in a [Private Use Area](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch23.pdf#G19465) (PUA)
in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), and so was likely a temporary encoding within STIX
before acceptance into Unicode proper.
AFII is the Association for Font Information Interchange,
who were originally in charge of ISO/IEC 10646,
the ISO standard corresponding to Unicode
and whose code points maintain parity with that of Unicode's.
D97C falls within the [Surrogates Area](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch23.pdf#G24089),
whose code points have no meaning individually,
so it was likely also a temporary encoding,
although I don't know why the AFII code point would differ from the Unicode PUA one.

Related is the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) Specification:
[Section 6.2.5.1 ISO Symbol Entity Sets](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chapter6.html#sec6.2.5.1)
provides the same tables as STIX,
and our character can again be found in group [ISO AMS-A](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chap6/ISOAMSAe2.html).

## ISO/IEC TR 9573-13:1991 and pals

The technical report, whose long name is
[ISO/IEC TR 9573-13:1991 Techniques for using SGML — Part 13: Public entity sets for mathematics and science](https://www.iso.org/standard/17332.html),
was published in July 1991.
Although their site claims there was never a newer version,
there is a [document with the same name](https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003doc/9573.html)
last updated on 8 December 2003.
It indeed lists U+237C in [Section 7.1 isoamsa](https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003doc/9573sec7-1.html),
but evidently this came *after* it was added to the Unicode Standard.

The actual tech report itself doesn't provide much more information than the newer document,
shown in the capture above:
all it contains is its short name, the glyph, its old code point D97C, and a description.
(If you're a UBC student or faculty, you can get access to the
[tech report via Techstreet](https://subscriptions.techstreet.com/products/301761)
or [here](https://libgen.gs/edition.php?id=141516185).)
The only other reference is found in Section 6.2.5 Arrow Relations,
which gives the same entity listings as
[ISOasma.ent](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/sgml-data/-/blob/master/sgml/entities/sgml-iso-entities-9573-13.1991/ISOamsa.ent#L11)
in the Debian package [`sgml-data`](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/sgml-data).
The Foreword, though, mentions that this tech report replaces an earlier annex.

> h) Part 13 replaces ISO 8879:1986 annex D (in part)

Taking a look at [ISO/IEC TR 9573:1988 Techniques for using SGML](https://www.iso.org/standard/17319.html) as well,
which people at UBC can also access via [CSA onDemand](https://resources.library.ubc.ca/page.php?id=2689)
as [CAN/CSA-Z243.210-89 (R2014)](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CAN%25100CSA-Z243.210-89/),
it also indicates that the symbols it uses comes from ISO 8879.

           title="8.3 Symbols

One of the difficulties in describing mathematics is caused by the extensive use of special
symbols, normally not available on computer keyboards. This application uses the entity references in annex D of ISO 8879 to solve this problem."
           caption="Excerpt from ISO/IEC TR 9573:1988, Section 8.3 Symbols" %}

However, this Annex D of [ISO 8879:1986 Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)](https://www.iso.org/standard/16387.html)
(which UBC people can again access as
[CAN/CSA-Z243.210.1-89 (R2018)](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CAN%25100CSA-Z243.210.1-89/)
via CSA onDemand)
doesn't contain our character, neither under ISO ASM-A as expected, nor anywhere else,
meaning that it must have been introduced by TR 9573-13.
