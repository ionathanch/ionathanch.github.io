Hello! My name is Jonathan, although I will occasionally refer to myself in cyberspace as Jon for brevity, and I use [he/him](http://pronoun.is/he/him) pronouns. I am in the final year of my BSc. in Computer Science and Physics at UBC, and am also a prospective Master's student at... some Canadian university, where I will be doing cool things related to programming languages theory. My interests range from type theory to logics to compilers.

## Research

I am currently working with Prof. [William J. Bowman](https://www.williamjbowman.com/index.html) on my undergraduate thesis, which involves implementing [sized types in Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/CoqTerminationDiscussion#sized). The resulting paper, "Practical Sized Types for Coq", was announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wilbowma/status/1205305932466421761) and a draft of it can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05601), along with the implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/ionathanch/coq/tree/dev).
