Known as RIGHT ANGLE WITH DOWARDS ZIGZAG ARROW,
angle with down zig-zag arrow,
and `angzarr`,
no one knows what ⍼ is meant to represent or where it originated from.
[Section 22.7 Technical Symbols](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch22.pdf#G12269)
from the Unicode Standard on the
[Miscellaneous Technical](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf) block
doesn't say anything about it.

The original proposal that included this character is
[Proposal for Encoding Additional Mathematical Symbols in the BMP (N2191)](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n2191.pdf)
from 14 March 2000, with origins from the
[STIX project](https://www.ams.org/STIX/).
That project page links to a number of relevant files dating all the way back to 1997,
and most importantly to the very first collation of
[character tables](https://www.ams.org/STIX/bnbranges.html) by Barbara Beeton
last updated on 24 June 1997.
Here we find that, in table [&ac-&cirmid](http://www.ams.org/STIX/bnbtable09a.html)
under codes with TR 9573 names, an entry for the character.

> D97C | &amp;angzarr; | angle with down zig-zag arrow

A [table from 18 July 1997](https://www.ams.org/STIX/bnb/9573-13.file)
clarifies that these are characters from the technical report TR 9573-13.
A later [table from 7 Feburary 1998](http://www.ams.org/STIX/stixfullr/stixfull-12.html)
with accompanying glyphs confirms that this is indeed the character we're looking for.

> E248 | <img id="angzarr" src="http://www.ams.org/STIX/glyphs/E2/UE248.gif"/> | angzarr | ISOAMSA | angle with down zig-zag arrow

The technical report, whose full name is
[ISO/IEC TR 9573-13:1991 Information technology — SGML support facilities — Techniques for using SGML — Part 13: Public entity sets for mathematics and science](https://www.iso.org/standard/17332.html),
was published in July 1991.
Although their site claims there was never a newer version,
there is a [document with the same name](https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003doc/9573.html)
last updated on 8 December 2003.
It indeed lists U+237C in [Section 7.1 isoamsa](https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003doc/9573sec7-1.html),
but evidently this came *after* it was added to the Unicode Standard.

Otherwise, the original document is paywalled and inaccessible.
IEC provides only a [seven-page preview](https://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_isoiec9573-13%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf)
with a table of contents; I would venture to guess that our character
is filed under Section 5.2.5 Arrow Relations,
since it was proposed along with a bunch of other arrow-like characters,
and its shortname ends in `-arr`.
Interestingly, the preview mentions that Part 13 replaces part of a different standard.

> h) Part 13 replaces ISO 8879:1986 annex D (in part);

The standard referenced is
[ISO 8879:1986 Information processing — Text and office systems — Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)](https://www.iso.org/standard/16387.html),
published in October 1986, and the original standard for SGML.
[The SGML Handbook](https://archive.org/details/sgmlhandbook0000gold/mode/2up)
by Charles F. Goldfarb contains the entire standard,
including Annex D and in particular D.4 Entity Sets (page 502).
However, neither `angzarr` nor any reference to zig-zags or overlaid angle characters exist,
so it must have been introduced by TR 9573-13.
