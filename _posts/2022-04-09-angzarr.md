Known as RIGHT ANGLE WITH DOWARDS ZIGZAG ARROW,
angle with down zig-zag arrow,
`\rangledownzigzagarrow`,
and `&angzarr;`,
no one knows what ⍼ is meant to represent or where it originated from.
[Section 22.7 Technical Symbols](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch22.pdf#G12269)
from the Unicode Standard on the
[Miscellaneous Technical](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf) block
doesn't say anything about it.

The original proposal that included this character is
[Proposal for Encoding Additional Mathematical Symbols in the BMP (N2191)](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n2191.pdf)
from 14 March 2000, with origins from the
[STIX project](https://www.ams.org/STIX/).
That project page links to a number of relevant files dating all the way back to 1997,
and most importantly to the very first collation of
[character tables](https://www.ams.org/STIX/bnbranges.html) by Barbara Beeton
last updated on 24 June 1997.
Here we find that, in table [&ac-&cirmid](http://www.ams.org/STIX/bnbtable09a.html)
under codes with TR 9573 names, an entry for the character.

> **AFII** | **ISO TR9573 entity** | **ISO TR9573 description**
  D97C | &amp;angzarr; | angle with down zig-zag arrow

(This table is later merged into a [larger table](http://www.ams.org/STIX/table09.html).)
A [table from 18 July 1997](https://www.ams.org/STIX/bnb/9573-13.file)
clarifies that these are characters from the technical report TR 9573-13.
A later [table from 7 Feburary 1998](http://www.ams.org/STIX/stixfullr/stixfull-12.html)
with accompanying glyphs confirms that this is indeed the character we're looking for.

> **Unicode** | **Glyph** | **SGML** | **Name** | **Description**
  E248 | <img class="inline-img" src="https://www.ams.org/STIX/glyphs/E2/UE248.gif"/> | angzarr | ISOAMSA | angle with down zig-zag arrow

The Unicode code point E248 is, of course, not its current actual code point.
That one is located in a [Private Use Area](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch23.pdf#G19465) (PUA)
in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), and so was likely a temporary encoding within STIX
before acceptance into Unicode proper.
AFII is the Association for Font Information Interchange,
who were originally in charge of ISO/IEC 10646,
the ISO standard corresponding to Unicode
and whose code points maintain parity with that of Unicode's.
D97C falls within the [Surrogates Area](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch23.pdf#G24089),
whose code points have no meaning individually,
so it was likely also a temporary encoding,
although I don't know why the AFII code point would differ from the Unicode PUA one.

Related is the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) Specification:
[Section 6.2.5.1 ISO Symbol Entity Sets](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chapter6.html#sec6.2.5.1)
provides the same tables as STIX,
and our character can again be found in group [ISO AMS-A](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chap6/ISOAMSAe2.html).

## ISO/IEC TR 9573-13:1991 and pals

The technical report, whose long name is
[ISO/IEC TR 9573-13:1991 Techniques for using SGML — Part 13: Public entity sets for mathematics and science](https://www.iso.org/standard/17332.html),
was published in July 1991.
Although their site claims there was never a newer version,
there is a [document with the same name](https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003doc/9573.html)
last updated on 8 December 2003.
It indeed lists U+237C in [Section 7.1 isoamsa](https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003doc/9573sec7-1.html),
but evidently this came *after* it was added to the Unicode Standard.

The actual tech report itself doesn't provide much more information than the newer document,
shown in the capture above:
all it contains is its short name, the glyph, its old code point D97C, and a description.
(If you're a UBC student or faculty, you can get access to the
[tech report via Techstreet](https://subscriptions.techstreet.com/products/301761)
or [here](https://libgen.gs/edition.php?id=141516203).)
The only other reference is found in Section 6.2.5 Arrow Relations,
which gives the same entity listings as
[ISOasma.ent](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/sgml-data/-/blob/master/sgml/entities/sgml-iso-entities-9573-13.1991/ISOamsa.ent#L11)
in the Debian package [`sgml-data`](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/sgml-data).
The Foreword, though, mentions that this tech report replaces an earlier annex.

> h) Part 13 replaces ISO 8879:1986 annex D (in part)

Taking a look at [ISO/IEC TR 9573:1988 Techniques for using SGML](https://www.iso.org/standard/17319.html) as well,
which people at UBC can also access via [CSA onDemand](https://resources.library.ubc.ca/page.php?id=2689)
as [CAN/CSA-Z243.210.1-89 (R2018)](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CAN%25100CSA-Z243.210.1-89/),
it also indicates that the symbols it uses comes from ISO 8879.

However, this Annex D of [ISO 8879:1986 Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)](https://www.iso.org/standard/16387.html)
(which UBC people can again access as

doesn't contain our character, neither under ISO ASM-A as expected, nor anywhere else.

Back in TR 9573-13, Section 5 mentions that the symbols tables contain

> a glyph identifier, registered in accordance with ISO/IEC 10036. The glyph identifier is shown in
decimal and hexadecimal representation;

this refers to the code point D97C/55676.
While [ISO/IEC 10036:1993 Procedure for registration of glyph and glyph collection identifiers](https://www.iso.org/standard/17998.html)
only describes glyph registration,
the actual [10036 registry](https://10036ra.org/glyph-index.html) exists online.
Our character can be found among code points [556xx](https://10036ra.org/glyph-table.php?page=556).
In 2020, the [glyph table](https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/tr/10036/ed-1/en/GlyphTable.pdf) was standardized as
[ISO/IEC TR 10036:2020 Registered glyph identifiers](https://www.iso.org/standard/79490.html),
containing the same glyphs.

> | 55676 |
| <img class="inline-img" src="https://10036ra.org/retrieve.php?gid=55676" /> |

The registry indicates that this glyph is among thousands inherited from
the Association for Font Information Interchange (AFII).
They had their own registry as well,
cited by ISO/IEC 10036:1996, Annex D Bibliography.

> Association for Font Information Interchange (AFII)
_International Glyph Register, Volume 1: Alphabetic Scripts and Symbols_. 1993.

The AFII is long dissolved in favour of Unicode over their glyph registry;
an [email from Asmus Freytag](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/99342-afii.txt),
their former president, describes its history just before dissolution.
Notably, it appears that anyone could register a glyph with the AFII
for a fee of 5$ to 50$ (about 8.60$ to 86$, accounting for inflation).
Even if the _International Glyph Register_ can be found,
it likely merely contains another table with the glyph, the indentifier, and the short description.
To know its origins would require the original registration request that added the character,
but it's unlikely that such old documents from a now-defunct non-profit organization in the 90s
would have been kept or digitized.

## The Glyph

What is the glyph *supposed* to look like?
Obviously without a definitive source, we can't answer this question,
but we can look at what various interpretations of a downwards zig-zag arrow
overtop a right angle exist, starting with a vector reproduction of the glyph in the 10036 registry,
originally a 96 px × 96 px GIF and supposedly copied from AFII's registry.

{% include image.html
           img="/assets/images/angzarr/10036 glyph.svg"
           width="30%"
           title="⍼"
           caption="Reproduction of glyph from 10036 registry" %}

The zig-zag in question has a horizontal middle bar,
with the lower bar crossing the corner of the angle.
Then we have the glyph from TR 9573-13,
which is luckily available as a proper PDF with vector glyphs
rather than a scanned document.

{% include image.html
           img="/assets/images/angzarr/TR 9573-13 glyph.svg"
           width="30%"
           title="⍼"
           caption="Vector glyph from ISO/IEC TR 9573-13:1991" %}

The zig-zag in question also contains a horizontal middle bar,
but the lower bar doesn't cross the angle corner.
The arrowhead has a rather unusual shape, but is in line with the arrowheads of the other glyphs.
Strangely, the vertical bar of the right angle doesn't have a consistent width.
Next is a vector reproduction of the glyph from both STIX and MathML,
which were originally 32 px × 32 px GIFs.

{% include image.html
           img="/assets/images/angzarr/STIX glyph.svg"
           width="30%"
           title="⍼"
           caption="Reproduction of glyph from STIX and MathML" %}

For some reason, the middle bar of the zig-zag is now diagonal rather than horizontal.
There's also an extra pixel at the bottom bend,
and the arrow now crosses the corner of the right angle.
Fun fact: the horizontal bar of the right angle is a single pixel shorter than the vertical bar.
Then we have the glyph as designed in the Unicode proposal document.

{% include image.html
           img="/assets/images/angzarr/N2191 glyph.svg"
           width="30%"
           title="⍼"
           caption="Vector glyph from proposal N2191" %}

This one just looks like a vectorized version of the previous pixellated version.
I don't think the pixellated glyph is a downsampled version of this glyph,
since the arrowhead in this glyph is larger and extends beyond the angle corner.

{% include image.html
           img="/assets/images/angzarr/font glyphs.svg"
           width="75%"
           title="⍼⍼⍼⍼"
           caption="Glyphs from GNU Unifont, STIX Two, Julia Mono, and Noto Sans Math/Symbols" %}

These last four are examples of the character in four different fonts that provide it:
[GNU Unifont](https://www.unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html),
[STIX Two](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/stix2-otf),
[Julia Mono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/), and
[Noto Sans Math](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Math)/[Noto Sans Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Symbols).
Unifont's glyph looks like an improved version of the pixellated version:
the extra pixel is gone, both bends are the same size around the vertical bar,
and the arrowhead is slightly larger and more distinguishable.
STIX Two's resembles the proposal version but with a fancier arrowhead.
Julia Mono's is a little weird: the bottommost bar of the zig-zag isn't straight,
and the vertical bar of the angle again has inconsistent widths.
Finally, Noto Sans' glyph doesn't even have a zig-zag;
They've chosen to interpret the character as a wavy arrow rather than a zig-zag arrow.
All of these have an arrow crossing the right angle corner,
which seems to be a distinguishing characteristic of the character.
