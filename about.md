### The author:

Hello! I'm Jonathan Chan. Although most people call me Jonathan, sometimes I'll refer to myself in cyberspace as Jon because it's fewer characters. (If they were easier to type, I would use a single non-ASCII Unicode character as an identifier.) I use [he/him](http://pronoun.is/he/him) pronouns.

I am finishing up my BSc. in Computer Science and Physics at UBC. This will be updated with more exciting related news as they develop. For now, my academic interests include programming languages and type systems. I am currently working with Prof. [William J. Bowman](https://www.williamjbowman.com/index.html) for my undergrad honours thesis, which involves implementing [sized types in Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/CoqTerminationDiscussion#sized). A draft of the paper, "Practical Sized Types for Coq", can be found on his website [here](https://www.williamjbowman.com/#sized-coq). It's recently been rejected from CPP 2020!

### The blog:

The decision to host my own server somewhat coincided with when I took my last quantum mechanics course, resulting in me buying the domain name `ert.space`. (This is also why the blog is named ⟨ortho\|normal⟩.) I was convinced that, aside from the obvious domain hack on [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space), I could spell a multitude of words ending in -ert. So far, none of them have the same punch as [hilb.ert.space](https://hilb.ert.space), but I'm stuck with it until I come up with something better.

The actual content of the blog is a mishmash of whatever I found worth the time writing out in long form. It was originally posted on Medium, then on a self-hosted instance of Ghost, then finally as a static Jekyll site hosted by GitHub Pages. It's mostly uninteresting, and the more valuable content is in my personal wiki. The source can be found [here](https://github.com/ionathanch/ionathanch.github.io).
