Hello! My name is Jonathan, although I will occasionally refer to myself in cyberspace as Jon for brevity. I am a prospective Master's student at UBC, where I will be doing cool things related to programming languages theory. My interests range from dependent types to compilers to logics.

## Research

I worked with Prof. [William J. Bowman](https://www.williamjbowman.com/index.html) on my undergraduate thesis, which involved implementing [sized types in Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/CoqTerminationDiscussion#sized). The implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ionathanch/coq/tree/dev).
